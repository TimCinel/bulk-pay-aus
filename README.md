# CSV to ABA/Cemtex

This is a web-based tool for creating ABA/"Cemtex" files used by Australian banks for bulk payments.

You upload a CSV file in a simple format, and the website converts it to the ABA format.

This might be the right solution for you if you've ever asked any of the following questions:

* How do I make payments to multiple people at once?
* How do I automate payments for my business?
* How do I transfer money from a bank account using an API?
